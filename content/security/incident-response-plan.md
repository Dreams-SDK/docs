## Incident Response Plan

### Introduction

The purpose of the document is to establish the goals and the vision for the incident management process in the MYRTLECONSULTING S.A. (“we” or “Cloudback”).
This document provides guidance for employees or incident responders who believe they have discovered or are responding to an incident related to the Cloudback.

### Escalation

Email to support@cloudback.it should be used to notify the support team of run-of-the mill issues. Be a good witness. Behave as if you were reporting a crime and include lots of specific details about what you have discovered.

### Severity

#### Low and Medium Severity

Issues meeting this severity are simply suspicions or odd behaviors. They are not verified and require further investigation. There is no clear indicator that systems have tangible risk and do not require emergency response. This includes suspicious emails, outages, strange activity on a laptop.

#### High Severity

High severity issues relate to problems where an adversary or active exploitation hasn’t been proven yet, and may not have happened, but likely to happen. This may include vulnerabilities with direct risk of exploitation, threats with risk or adversarial persistence on our systems (eg: backdoors, malware), malicious access of business data (eg: passwords, vulnerability data, payments information), or threats that put any individual at risk of physical harm.

High severity issues should include an email to support@cloudback.it with “Urgent” in the subject line to alert incident responders.

#### Critical Severity

Critical issues relate to actively exploited risks and involve a malicious actor. Identification of active exploitation is critical to this severity category.

Critical severity issues should involve all the support team to investigate the issue as soon as possible. Continue escalation until you receive acknowledgement. 

### Internal Issues

Issues where the malicious actor is an internal employee, contractor, vendor, or partner requires sensitive handling. Please contact the team@cloudback.it directly. These are critical issues and must be pushed to follow up.

### Compromised Communications

If there are IT communication risks, the support team will announce an out of band solution within the company, and will communicate this to team over cell phones.

### Response Steps

For critical issues, the support team will follow an iterative response process designed to investigate, contain exploitation, remediate our vulnerability, and document a post-mortem with the lessons of an incident.

1. The support team will determine if a lawyer be included and attorney client privilege between responders will begin.
2. The investigation meeting involving support and development teams will take place.
3. The following meeting will occur at regular intervals until the incident is resolved:

#### Incident Response Meeting — Agenda

- Incident Timeline
- Indicators of the Incident
- Investigative Q&A
- Emergency Mitigations
- Long Term Mitigations (including Root Cause Analysis)
- Everything Else

The support team will _Incident Timeline_ with all known temporal data related to the incident. All _Indicators of the Incident_ will be updated and shared among incident responders. The group will add new knowns and unknowns to the _Investigative Q&A_. A list of tactical _Emergency Mitigations_ will be updated. A list of long term, post incident _Long Term Mitigations_ will be updated. Once items related to response are covered, technical responders may leave the meeting and meta-topics (_Everything Else_) related to the incident are discussed (communications, legal issues, blog posts, etc) with leadership.
